# What is this?

**Major Wip**

**Since Google now has composer, this has been shelved but I didn't want to lose what I've done**

This is the terraform code to create the following airflow architecture.

TBD

**tf_gcs_state** 

- directory contains the terraform code to create a gcs bucket to store the terraform state for the terraform code in the other directory.

**tf_cloudsql_rabbitcompeng_airflowcompeng**

- directory contains the terraform code to create the complete GCP airflow stack.

**Please refer to https://github.com/turnerlabs/airflow_stack_gcp_ce_images for creating the Compute Engine Images that run in this stack.**
